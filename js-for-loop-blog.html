        <h1>How to Use the for Loop in JavaScript</h1>
        <p>In this blog, we’ll learn about the for loop JavaScript provides. We’ll look at how for...in loop
            statements are used in JavaScript, the syntax, examples of how it works, when to use or avoid it, and what
            other types of loops we can use instead.</p>
        <h2>Why Use For Loops in JavaScript Code</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, just as in other programming languages, we use loops to read or access the items of a
            collection. The collection can be an array or an object. Every time the loop statement cycles through the
            items in a collection, we call it an <strong>iteration</strong></p>

        <p>There are two ways to access an item in a collection. The first way is via its key in the collection, which
            is an index in an array or a property in an object. The second way is via the item itself, without needing
            the key.</p>
        <h2>Definition of the for…in Loop</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript for loop goes through or iterates keys of a collection. Using these keys, you can then access
            the item it represents in the collection.

            The collection of items can be either arrays, objects, or even strings.

        </p>
        <h2>Syntax of the for…in Loop</h2>
        <div class="blog">
            <img class="blog-img" src="/images/for-in-loop.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>In this code block, value is the collection of items we’re iterating over. It can be an object, array,
            string, and so on. key will be the key of each item in value, changing on each iteration to the next key in
            the list.</p>
        <h2>Using the for Loop with Objects</h2>
        <p>When using for...in loop to iterate an object in JavaScript, the iterated keys or properties — which, in the
            snippet above, are represented by the key variable — are the object’s own properties.

            As objects might inherit items through the prototype chain, which includes the default methods and
            properties of Objects as well as Object prototypes we might define, we should then use hasOwnProperty.</p>
        <h3>For loop example over an iterable object</h3>
        <div class="blog">
            <img class="blog-img" src="/images/for-in-loop-obj.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>Notice that the order of the iteration is ascending for the keys (that is, starting with digits in numerical
            order and then letters in alphabetical order). However, this outputted order is different from the index
            order of the items as created when initializing the object.</p>
        <h2>Using a for…in Loop with Arrays</h2>
        <p>When using the for...in loop to iterate arrays in JavaScript, key in this case will be the indices of the
            elements. However, the indices might be iterated in a random order.

            So, if the value variable in the for...in loop syntax structure we showed above was an array of five items,
            key would not be guaranteed to be 0 to 4. Some indices might precede others. </p>
        <h3>For…in loop array example</h3>
        <div class="blog">

        </div>
        <h2>When Not to Use a JavaScript for…in Loop</h2>
        <h3>Orderly iterating of arrays</h3>
        <p>As the index order in the iterations is not guaranteed when using the for...in loop, it’s recommended to not
            iterate arrays if maintaining the order is necessary.

            This is especially essential if you’re looking to support browsers like IE, which iterates in the order the
            items are created rather than in the order of the indices. This is different from the way current modern
            browsers work, which iterate arrays based on the indices in ascending order.

            So, for example, if you have an array of four items and you insert an item into position three, in modern
            browsers the for...in loop will still iterate the array in order from 0 to 4. In IE, when using a for...in
            loop, it will iterate the four items that were originally in the array in the beginning and then reach the
            item that was added at position three.</p>
        <h3>Making changes while iterating</h3>
        <p>Any addition, deletion, or modification to properties doesn’t guarantee an ordered iteration. Making changes
            to properties in a for...in loop should be avoided. This is mostly due to its unordered nature.

            So, if you delete an item before you reach it in the iteration, the item will not be visited at all in the
            entire loop.

            Similarly, if you make changes to a property, it doesn’t guarantee that the item won’t be revisited again.
            So, if a property is changed it might be visited twice in the loop rather than once.

            In addition, if a property is added during iteration, it might or might not be visited during the iteration
            at all.

            Due to these situations, it’s best to avoid making any alterations, deletions, or additions to an object in
            a for...in loop.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By using the JavaScript for...in loop, we can loop through keys or properties of an object. It can be useful
            when iterating object properties or for debugging, but should be avoided when iterating arrays or making
            changes to the object. </p>
